# Contibuting
Contributing is welcomed! We have extensive documentation bellow as well as comments in the code to help you out.
Please take a look at our GitHub issues for ideas on what to work on. Our one request is that you keep our comments in the code. You are welcome to remove them and then add them back, but please have them in whatever code you submit. To contibute, please do all your work on a fork and then open a PR.

## Pull Requests
All work should be done on a fork. PR's should be to the Heptagram-Staged branch. 

## Bot Community.
We are working on setting up a Discord Server for our community. This will serve as Bot Support and a place for our developers and contributers to talk. This server will be up and running in the very near future.
